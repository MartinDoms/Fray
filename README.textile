F# Ray Tracer

Note: there are still some bugs because I had to rewrite a large chunk of this in one night. The renderer and its API will be changing a lot.

Note that the lights are not positioned correctly on all of the spheres in the sample below and the plane is not correctly lit or shadowed. I'm sure it's something simple/stupid.
